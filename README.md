# Azur Lane API
![Test](https://github.com/LeNitrous/azur-lane-api/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

This is a unofficial API that returns JSON data from [Azur Lane](https://azurlane.yo-star.com/) and is always updated to the latest game version. 


## State

We're on the process of re-writing the entire backend, so check back later!

## Motivation

### General
There aren't many data providers for this mobile game. For aspiring developers to help out the community. Opportunities like Discord bots or self-hosted websites with tools and viewers.

## Credits

Our project is powered by [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=azur-lane-api&utm_campaign=oss)! We host the project there and if you have a upcoming project, you should consider choosing Vercel as your host.
